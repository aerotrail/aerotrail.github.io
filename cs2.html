      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-600 mb-2">Business Need</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">The client wanted to streamline and scale their machine learning pipeline — from data ingestion to real-time predictions — for fraud detection use cases. Their existing stack lacked consistency, reusability, and traceability across models and datasets.</p>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-600 mb-2">Solution Design</h2>
      <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700">
        <p><strong>Collaborative Data Preparation</strong> – Raw transactional and user data were cleaned and enriched using Delta Live Tables. Features were engineered using PySpark and registered in the <strong>Databricks Feature Store</strong> for reuse across teams and experiments.</p>
        <p><strong>Model Development</strong> – Models were trained using <strong>SparkML pipelines</strong> and hyperparameter tuning was managed via grid search in parallel compute environments. All model versions and metrics were tracked using <strong>MLflow</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>MLOps Practices</strong> – Automated CI/CD pipelines were set up to retrain models based on new features or data drift signals. Staging and production environments were governed using MLflow model registry and approvals.</p>
        <p><strong>Deployment</strong> – Final models were deployed as REST endpoints via Databricks serving, with real-time scoring integrated into the client’s fraud detection system. Monitoring tools alerted on latency, throughput, and model confidence thresholds.</p>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-600 mb-2">Results & Benefits</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
        <li>🚀 70% reduction in model deployment time (from 2 weeks to 2 days)</li>
        <li>🔁 Features reused across 5+ model families using Feature Store</li>
        <li>🔍 100% auditability of experiments and models via MLflow tracking</li>
        <li>⚙️ Real-time scoring latency reduced to &lt;300ms</li>
        <li>📈 Teams adopted continuous model monitoring and A/B testing practices</li>
      </ul>
