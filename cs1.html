      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-600 mb-2">Business Challenge</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">The client’s decade-old Hadoop infrastructure was holding them back — sluggish batch jobs, rising costs, and fractured tools across data and ML. They needed to modernize, unify, and accelerate — without disrupting existing operations.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-600 mb-2">The Migration Journey</h2>
      <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700">
        <p><strong>Phase 1: Discovery & Alignment</strong> – Through collaborative workshops and platform diagnostics, Aerotrail mapped pain points and priorities. Cross-team input revealed bottlenecks in data refresh cycles and limitations in model experimentation. This became the blueprint for a phased Databricks adoption.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 2: Foundation & Architecture</strong> – A scalable Databricks workspace was set up with Unity Catalog for governance. CI/CD pipelines ensured reproducibility, while environment isolation gave teams safe space to build and test.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 3: Pilot Conversion</strong> – High-value Spark and Hive jobs were rebuilt using Delta Lake. The ML team began using MLflow for reproducible experiments, significantly reducing time-to-model.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 4: Full Migration</strong> – 80+ TB of data was migrated from HDFS to cloud storage with integrity checks, lineage validation, and schema harmonization. Teams worked jointly to resolve data quality flags during cutover.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 5: Enablement & Training</strong> – 40+ data professionals were trained in Databricks SQL, Python notebooks, Delta Live Tables, and job orchestration — enabling them to confidently own and evolve the new platform.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 6: Production Cutover</strong> – Final workloads were transitioned with zero downtime. Dashboards and alerting ensured smooth handoff. Cost optimization guardrails were introduced for ongoing scalability.</p>
